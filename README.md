When first setting up Nudge for multiple environments, the process felt a little daunting.
Cutucava was written in my personal time to streamline this process. Not just for myself but for other sysadmins as well.
Nudge has been an invaluable tool for me, I hope to give back in my own way and make things easier by simplifying its deployment.

3. **Deploy**: Follow the provided instructions to deploy Nudge on your macOS.
4. **Uninstall**: If you're testing and want to start fresh, run the uninstallation script.
