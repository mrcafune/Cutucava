## Why "ðŸŒº Cutucava"?

When first setting up Nudge for multiple environments, the process felt a little daunting.
Cutucava was written in my personal time to streamline this process. Not just for myself but for other sysadmins as well.
Nudge has been an invaluable tool for me, I hope to give back in my own way and make things easier by simplifying its deployment.
I chose the name as it's a conjugation of the verb "Cutucar", which is loosely translated to Nudge in PT-BR (a language close to my heart).

1. **Download**: Clone or download this repository.
2. **Execute**: Run the Cutucava script.
3. **Deploy**: Follow instructions to deploy Nudge.
4. **Uninstall**: If you're testing and want to start fresh, run the uninstallation script.
